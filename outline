E N D  G O A L: 

Make a great looking and functional project to display in my portfolio.  Should demonstrate knowledge of fundamental web development skills and perhaps creativity.  


let's get T E C H N I C A L:

Uses a number of packages for authentication (passport, express-session, mysql) and uses Node.Js for a backend server, mysql as a database, and your mom as- ok oops.


W H A T  S H O U L D  I T  L O O K  L I K E?:

After sign in, user should land on the home page.  The home page will include stats about their friends (most recent solves, personal best, personal best average, et c), upcoming cubing events, and maybe blog posts?  Do I want to make a blog thing?  I'm imagining it to be almost like a light social networking platform but for cubing.  The home page should alse drop the user into a general chat room.  There will be options to start solving alone, or to make a new race room.  The race room feature will be implemented after I get the solo timer working fine and have insertion and recall into the database.  

There should be a practice option for the cube timer and a recorded option.  Practice won't record the time- recorded will record the time.  If a time is recorded, it is recorded, so even if it's a mistake it goes in.  Should users have the option to remove times?  Only in practice, I think, for the recorded option users could just get rid of all their bad times.  Maybe they could flag a mistaken time as 'mistake' but that's already getting a little advanced.  

Primary goal is to be able to record times and have them inserted into the db and queried and displayed after.  After that I can start implementing the more advanced features.

What should the home page have on it?  
+  navbar: (what pages should there be?)
- home
- stats (profile)
- site ranking stats
- race page
+  chat room (hideable, can leave)
+  show your best time, best average
+  link to start / join race room

to do:

fix mysql calls.  just open one connection and close it at the very end.  this is fine.

A ranking system might be unrealistic at this point, I'm thinking.  It's just because the solves aren't verified and there's really no way to verify them.  so what's to stop someone from just tapping quickly and getting an unrealistic time and then being on top of the site records?  I could eventually have verified solves with an uploaded video maybe?  It just doesn't seem like a viable idea.  

The whole database idea in general I guess isn't so great?  I already made the profile page though, I may as well have it so you can search for users and choose to follow them.  That woul dbe a good demonstration of skill too.  

So I think on the navbar and on the home page, I'll have a search field.

I have an autocomplete search field that correctly pulls all of the handles from the database.  so now I need to make it do something when clicked.  it should bring you to the user's profile.  Then I can add things to the profile page like being able to follow someone and see their times on the home page.  

How will that be accomplished?  the list of users that the current user is following will have to be stored somewhere with persistance.  I guess in the database, though I feel weird about storing too much info in there or making too many like separate tables?  I guess I could put it under the users table actually...

No, I just looked it up, I think the best way to do this is to use an INNER JOIN on a new table.  Just learned about that.  I tried it out and it looks like it'll work.  

I don't like the idea of it though, do I really want to make a followers thing?  I'm second guessing my idea now.  Do I really need to add new features?  I  mean I kind of like the race room idea.  at least it's a chat room where you can just hang out and solve together.  It needs to have a scramble generator as well.  there's enough smaller things I can do.  user profiles are good enough for now.  I don't need a follow mechanism.  

Ok so that means..to do is:

-  add scramble generator, inspection time, sound notification on timer
-  race rooms
-  add to chat functionality
-  go to user profile from search bar
-  clean up user profile
-  clean up navbar styling
